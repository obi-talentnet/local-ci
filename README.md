# local ci

This is a small utility to assist with running tests et al on our local applications.

### application usage

To add the CI to your local project kindly add the below to your `package.json or composer file` file in the script section.

```js
 "fetch-ci": "wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/obi-talentnet/local-ci/main/local-ci.sh"
```
To install:
Type `sh local-ci.sh` in your terminal after running `npm run fetch-ci`. FYI this is a personal project i use for linting and running tests locally,
you are free to use or fork this repo at will.
NB: php setup: WIP
